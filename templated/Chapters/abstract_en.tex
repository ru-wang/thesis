    With the rise of artificial intelligence concepts and the development of industries such as AR, drones, mobile robots, and autonomous driving, there is a growing demand for high-precision, high-efficiency, and highly robust 3D sensing in industry and academia. In the SLAM algorithm, the speed and accuracy of the state estimation algorithm greatly limits the performance of the SLAM application. The traditional batch bundle adjustment solver sacrifices efficiency in order to ensure versatility. Existing solver based on incremental bundle adjustment is very efficient, but difficult to integrate into other SLAM systems due to the high degree of coupling. Based on the above analysis, this paper proposes a general incremental bundle adjustment solver for VISLAM, which provides built-in cost functions based on IMU preintegration and reprojection error, while retaining the interfaces for customized cost function types. Meanwile, we provide a variety types of linear solver algorithm, which ensure efficiency and versatility.
