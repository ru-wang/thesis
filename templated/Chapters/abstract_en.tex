    With the rise of artificial intelligence concepts and the development of industries such as AR, drones, mobile robots, and autonomous driving, there is a growing demand for high-precision, high-efficiency, and highly robust 3D sensing in industry and academia. In the SLAM algorithm, the speed and accuracy of the state estimation algorithm greatly limits the performance of the SLAM application. The traditional batch bundle adjustment solver sacrifices efficiency in order to ensure versatility. Existing solver based on incremental bundle adjustment is very efficient, but difficult to integrate into other SLAM systems due to the high degree of coupling. Based on the above analysis, we proposed a general incremental bundle adjustment framework for VISLAM, which is highly efficient and versatility.

    In the non-linear solver part, we proposed an incremental bundle adjustment framework, provideing built-in cost functions based on IMU preintegration and reprojection error as well as a variety types of local parameterization methods, while retaining the interfaces for customization; In the linearization part, we implemented an incremental Schur complement method based on factor graph in order to reduce the redundant computations. We alao addressed the rank-deficient problem while solving the Schur equation, by proposing a Hybrid LM-DL method, which enhanced the numerical stability of the linear solution without affecting the increment udpate process of the Schur complement; And in the linear solver part, we implemented a batch Cholesky solver and a incremental preconditioned conjugate graphdient solver. Users can also implement his own linear solver. Finally in the back-substitution part, we proposed a Partial Bayes Tree algorithm to improve the efficiency and variable consistency of the back-substitution process.

    This whole bundle adjustment framework is based on the block sparse matrix and has been tested on the simulated dataset and the real dataset provided by SLAM++. The efficiency and accuracy of the solver are verified by experiments.
